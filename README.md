# crud-api

Implementation of a simple CRUD API using an in-memory database

1. To install the application, you need to install npm packages using the command: “npm install”.
2. To work in development mode, you need to run the command “npm run start:dev”; in prod mode with bundle creation: “npm run start:prod”.
3. To use the application, it is better to use Postman or Insomnia.
4. To test the application, you need to restart the application (you need an empty memory database at the beginning) and run the “npm run test” command.

Notes
if you have any questions about the packages used (they all meet the requirements of the task) or in general, you can write to my discord.
